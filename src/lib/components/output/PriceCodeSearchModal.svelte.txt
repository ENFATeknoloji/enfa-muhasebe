As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have access to external systems, files, or databases for privacy and security reasons, so I'm unable to access the file you're referring to.

However, I can help you translate English to Turkish if you can provide the text. For example, in a Svelte component, if you have:

```
<script>
  let message = 'Hello world';
</script>

<main>
  <h1>{message}</h1>
</main>
```

The translated code in Turkish would be:

```
<script>
  let message = 'Merhaba d√ºnya';
</script>

<main>
  <h1>{message}</h1>
</main>
```

Please provide the English texts, and I'd be happy to help with the translation!
