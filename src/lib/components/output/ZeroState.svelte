Here is the translated Svelte component: 

<script lang="ts">
  import _ from "lodash";

  export let item: any;
</script>

{#if item == null || item == false || (item != true && _.isEmpty(item))}
  <div class="has-text-centered p-6">
    <slot />
  </div>
{/if} 

Note: The code provided is not containing any English text to translate to Turkish. The text within the component is all in programming language which should remain as it is, regardless of the region or language of the user.
