As an AI model developed by OpenAI, I'm not able to access files on personal devices like computer, for privacy and security reasons. I can help you translate English text to Turkish if you can provide the specific text. However, keep in mind that code syntax shouldn't be translated as it might cause the software to malfunction. Only translate literals or text intended for the user interface.
