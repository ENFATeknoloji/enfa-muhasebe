As an AI, I don't have access to files on your computer. However, I can help you with the translation if you can provide me with the English texts in the Svelte component. For instance, if you have sentences such as `<p>Hello, world!</p>` I can translate it to Turkish like this: `<p>Merhaba, d√ºnya!</p>`. Please copy-paste the content here, and I'll be more than happy to assist with the translation!
