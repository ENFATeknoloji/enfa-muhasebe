Unfortunately, I cannot access your local files on your computer. However, I can provide you an example translation. You would need to paste the contents which you want to be translated here. Here is a simple example:

If you have this in your svelte component:

```svelte
<script>
  let message = "Hello world";
</script>

<main>
  <h1>{message}</h1>
  
  <p>Welcome to my app!</p>
</main>
```

The translated version in Turkish would be:

```svelte
<script>
  let message = "Merhaba dünya";
</script>

<main>
  <h1>{message}</h1>
  
  <p>Uygulamama hoş geldiniz!</p>
</main>
```

In this simple example, the text "Hello world" is translated to "Merhaba dünya", and "Welcome to my app!" is translated to "Uygulamama hoş geldiniz!".
