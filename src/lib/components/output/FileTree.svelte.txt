As an AI language model developed by OpenAI, I can't access files on a local machine or network because I don't have ability to view or retrieve personal data unless it has been shared with me in the conversation. I respect user's privacy and confidentiality. 

However, I'm able to help you translate English text into Turkish if you can provide the English texts here in this conversation. For example, if the text in your component is "Submit", it would be translated into Turkish as "GÃ¶nder".
