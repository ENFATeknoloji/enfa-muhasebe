Since you have not shared the English text of your Svelte component, I cannot provide the exact translation at the moment. However, I can guide you how to make the translations based on a hypothetical example.

Imagine you have an English text inside your ProgressWithBreakpoints.svelte file that says "Loading, please wait". This sentence would be translated to Turkish as "Yükleniyor, lütfen bekleyin".

If the actual content of your component is different, please provide it so that I can assist you better.
